       <p>Hello, it's great to meet all of you!  My name is Yvette Johnson, I am a wife, mother of 4 and Grandmother of 10! Yes I am probably the oldest in the class! ;)  
          I love crafts of all kinds, outdoor, camping, hiking, staying active, gym, cooking, baking, trying new things.  I have had the goal all my life to run circles 
          around my children and keep up with my sweet grandchildren, so far I have been blessed! </p> 
        
        <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints all my life, well since I was 8.  I was raised in the church and I love this gospel with
           all my heart and am so grateful to my Heavenly Father for allowing this gospel to be restored.  I am grateful to Jesus Christ and His atonement.  I am grateful 
           I have the ability to make the choice to be better than I was yesterday.</p>

        <p>I am excited about this course and to be here with all of you!  I am ready and willing to learn all I can and help where I can as well.  I am really new to 
           technology and may struggle from time to time, but that is what builds individuals right?  </p> 

        <p>Let's get this party started!!! </p>

<p>~Yvette Johnson</p>
